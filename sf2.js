Caen was considered by many to be the recognized authority on what was, and what was not, beneath the city's dignity, and to him, Frisco was intolerable. {{cite web\n| last = Cohen | first = Sam\n| title = Locals know best: only tourists call it 'Frisco'\n| work = Golden Gater Online\n| publisher = San Francisco State University\n| date = September 11, 1997\n| url = http://www.journalism.sfsu.edu/www/pubs/gater/fall97/sept11/Frisco.html\n| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/19971123191158/http://www.journalism.sfsu.edu/www/pubs/gater/fall97/sept11/Frisco.html\n| archivedate=1997-11-23\n| accessdate =July 13, 2008\n}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"The City that Knows How\">{{cite web\n| url = http://sfpl.org/index.php?pg=2000141201\n| title = PPIE: The City That Knows How\n| accessdate =June 14, 2008\n| work = Amusing America\n| publisher = San Francisco Public Library\n| date = March 29, 2005\n}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"Baghdad by the Bay\">{{cite book\n| last = Caen | first = Herb\n| authorlink = Herb Caen\n| title = Baghdad-by-the-Bay\n| publisher = Doubleday\n| year = 1949\n| location = Garden City, NY\n| id = LC F869.S3 C12\n| isbn = 978-0-89174-047-6\n| oclc = 31060237\n}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"The Paris of the West\">{{cite web\n| url = http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jHvTZ1RL4I\n| title = The City\n| accessdate =June 5, 2009\n| work = UnknownWW2InColor\n| publisher = UnknownWW2InColor (Ramano-Archives)\n| year = 1939\n}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"Census 2010-GCT-PH1\">{{cite web\n| title = GCT-PH1 – Population, Housing Units, Area, and Density: 2010 – County – Census Tract\n| url = http://factfinder2.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=DEC_10_SF1_GCTPH1.CY07\n| work = [[2010 United States Census]] Summary File 1\n| publisher = United States Census Bureau\n| accessdate =July 11, 2011}}</ref>\n<!-- <ref name=\"Census 2010-GCT-PL2\">{{cite web\n| title = GCT-PL2 – Population and Housing Occupancy Status: 2010 – United States – Combined Statistical Area with Metropolitan and Micropolitan Statistical Area Components;
